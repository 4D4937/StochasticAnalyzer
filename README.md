# StochasticAnalyzer

## Overview

StochasticAnalyzer is a tool designed for analyzing and comparing stochastic processes over different timeframes. The tool generates visual representations to aid in understanding the variations and correlations in stochastic processes.

## Features

- **Timeframe Comparison**: Compare stochastic processes over various timeframes.
- **Custom Date Range**: Analyze data within a specified date range.
- **Visual Representation**: Generate plots to visualize the stochastic comparisons.

## Comparisons Available

1. **30m_6h vs 2h_6h**
    - Short-term vs medium-term comparisons.
    - Helps in identifying short-term fluctuations versus medium-term trends.
2. **2h_d vs 8h_d** (From 2023-01-01 to 2024-01-01)
    - Medium-term vs long-term comparisons.
    - Useful for understanding medium-term trends against daily trends over a year.
3. **30m_d vs 8h_d**
    - Short-term vs long-term comparisons.
    - Aids in recognizing short-term movements in the context of long-term trends.
